"An OpenStack deployment may require compliance activities for many purposes, "
"such as regulatory and legal requirements, customer need, privacy "
"considerations, and security best practices. Compliance, when done "
"correctly, unifies and strengthens the other security topics discussed in "
"this guide. This chapter has several objectives:"

"Industry standard security principles provide a baseline for compliance "
"certifications and attestations. If these principles are considered and "
"referenced throughout an OpenStack deployment, certification activities may "
"be simplified."

"<emphasis>Layered Defenses</emphasis>: Identify where risks exist in a cloud "
"architecture and apply controls to mitigate the risks. In areas of "
"significant concern, layered defences provide multiple complementary "
"controls to further mitigate risk. For example, to ensure adequate isolation "
"between cloud tenants, we recommend hardening QEMU, using a hypervisor with "
"SELinux support, enforcing mandatory access control policies, and reducing "
"the overall attack surface. The foundational principle is to harden an area "
"of concern with multiple layers of defense such that if any one layer is "
"compromised, other layers will exist to offer protection and minimize "
"exposure."

"<emphasis>Fail Securely</emphasis>: In the case of failure, systems should "
"be configured to fail into a closed secure state. For example, SSL "
"certificate verification should fail closed by severing the network "
"connection if the CNAME doesn't match the server's DNS name. Software often "
"fails open in this situation, allowing the connection to proceed without a "
"CNAME match, which is less secure and not recommended."

"<emphasis>Least Privilege</emphasis>: Only the minimum level of access for "
"users and system services is granted. This access is based upon role, "
"responsibility and job function. This security principal of least privilege "
"is written into several international government security policies, such as "
"NIST 800-53 Section AC-6 within the United States. "

"<emphasis>Compartmentalize</emphasis>: Systems should be segregated in a "
"such way that if one machine, or system-level service, is compromised the "
"security of the other systems will remain intact. Practically, the "
"enablement and proper usage of SELinux helps accomplish this goal."

"<emphasis>Logging Capability</emphasis>: Appropriate logging is implemented "
"to monitor for unauthorized use, incident response and forensics. It is "
"highly recommended that selected audit subsystems be Common Criteria "
"certified, which provides non-attestable event records in most countries."
