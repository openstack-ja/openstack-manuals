"Alice's organization requires that the security architecture protect the "

"SSL proxy on both public and internal services. Alice's organization has "
"implemented its own certificate authority. Alice contacts the PKI office in "
"her agency that manages her PKI and certificate issuance. Alice obtains "
"certificates issued by this CA and configures the services within both the "
"public and management security domains to use these certificates. Since "
"Alice's OpenStack deployment exists entirely on a disconnected from the "
"Internet network, she makes sure to remove all default CA bundles that "
"contain external public CA providers to ensure the OpenStack services only "
"accept client certificates issued by her agency's CA. Alice has registered "
"all of the services in the Keystone Services Catalog, using the internal "
"URLs for access by internal services. She has installed host-based intrusion "
"detection on all of the API endpoints."
