"OpenStack Networking in the Grizzly release enables the end-user or tenant "
"to define, utilize, and consume networking resources in new ways that had "
"not been possible in previous OpenStack Networking releases. OpenStack "
"Networking provides a tenant-facing API for defining network connectivity "
"and IP addressing for instances in the cloud in addition to orchestrating "
"the network configuration. With the transition to an API-centric networking "
"service, cloud architects and administrators should take into consideration "
"best practices to secure physical and virtual network infrastructure and "
"services."

"OpenStack Networking was designed with a plug-in architecture that provides "
"extensibility of the API via open source community or third-party services. "
"As you evaluate your architectural design requirements, it is important to "
"determine what features are available in OpenStack Networking core services, "
"any additional services that are provided by third-party products, and what "
"supplemental services are required to be implemented in the physical "
"infrastructure."

"This section is a high-level overview of what processes and best practices "
"should be considered when implementing OpenStack Networking. We will talk "
"about the current state of services that are available, what future services "
"will be implemented, and the current limitations in this project."
