"A key objective of Alice's cloud is to integrate with the existing auth "
"services and security resources. The key design parameters for this private "
"cloud are a limited scope of tenants, networks and workload type. This "
"environment can be designed to limit what available network resources are "
"available to the tenant and what are the various default quotas and security "
"policies are available. The network policy engine can be modified to "
"restrict creation and changes to network resources. In this environment, "
"Alice might want to leverage nova-network in the application of security "
"group polices on a per instance basis vs. neutron's application of security "
"group polices on a per port basis. L2 isolation in this environment would "
"leverage VLAN tagging. The use of VLAN tags will allow great visibility of "
"tenant traffic by leveraging existing features and tools of the physical "
"infrastructure."

"A major business driver for Bob is to provide an advanced networking "
"services to his customers. Bob's customers would like to deploy multi-tiered "
"application stacks. This multi-tiered application are either existing "
"enterprise application or newly deployed applications. Since Bob's Public "
"cloud is a multi-tenancy enterprise service, the choice to use for L2 "
"isolation in this environment is to use Overlay networking. Another aspect "
"of Bob's cloud is the self-service aspect where the customer can provision "
"available networking services as needed. These networking services encompass "
"L2 networks, L3 Routing, Network ACL and NAT. It is important that per-"
"tenant quota's be implemented in this environment."
