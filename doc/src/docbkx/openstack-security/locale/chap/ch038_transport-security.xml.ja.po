"We highly recommend enabling transport-level cryptography for your message "
"queue. Using SSL for the messaging client connections provides protection of "
"the communications from tampering and eavesdropping in-transit to the "
"messaging server. Below is guidance on how SSL is typically configured for "
"the two popular messaging servers Qpid and RabbitMQ. When configuring the "
"trusted certificate authority (CA) bundle that your messaging server uses to "
"verify client connections, it is recommended that this be limited to only "
"the CA used for your nodes, preferably an internally managed CA. The bundle "
"of trusted CAs will determine which client certificates will be authorized "
"and pass the client-server verification step of the setting up the SSL "
"connection. Note, when installing the certificate and key files, ensure that "
"the file permissions are restricted, for example chmod 0600, and the "
"ownership is restricted to the messaging server daemon user to prevent "
"unauthorized access by other processes and users on the messaging server."
