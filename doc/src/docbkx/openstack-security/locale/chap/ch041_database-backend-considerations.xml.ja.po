"The choice of database server is an important consideration in the security "
"of an OpenStack deployment. While security considerations are not the only "
"basis on which a database server must be chosen, security considerations are "
"the only ones within the scope of this book. In practice, OpenStack only "
"supports two database types: PostgreSQL and MySQL."

"PostgreSQL has a number of desirable security features such as Kerberos "
"authentication, object-level security, and encryption support. The "
"PostgreSQL community has done well to provide solid guidance, documentation, "
"and tooling to promote positive security practices."

"MySQL has a large community, wide-spread adoption, and provides high "
"availability options. MySQL also has the ability to provide enhanced client "
"authentication by way of plug-in authentication mechanisms. Forked "
"distributions in the MySQL community provide many options for consideration. "
"It is important to choose a specific implementation of MySQL based on a "
"thorough evaluation of the security posture and the level of support "
"provided for the given distribution."
