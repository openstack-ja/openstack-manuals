"Alice is willing to apply a relatively large amount of resources to software "
"packaging and maintenance. She will use these resources to build a highly "
"customized version of QEMU that has many components removed, thereby "
"reducing the attack surface. She will also ensure that all compiler "
"hardening options are enabled for QEMU. Alice accepts that these decisions "
"will increase long-term maintenance costs."

"Alice writes XSM policies (for Xen) and SELinux policies (for Linux domain "

"Alice also uses the TXT support in Xen to measure the hypervisor launch in "

"Bob is very concerned about instance isolation since the users in a public "
"cloud represent anyone with a credit card, meaning they are inherently "
"untrusted. Bob has just started hiring the team that will deploy the cloud, "
"so he can tailor his candidate search for specific areas of expertise. With "
"this in mind, Bob chooses a hypervisor based on its technical features, "
"certifications, and community support. KVM has an EAL 4+ common criteria "
"rating, with a layered security protection profile (LSPP) to provide added "
"assurance for instance isolation. This, combined with the strong support for "
"KVM within the OpenStack community drives Bob's decision to use KVM."

"Bob weighs the added cost of repackaging QEMU and decides that he cannot "
"commit those resources to the project. Fortunately, his Linux distribution "
"has already enabled the compiler hardening options. So he decides to use "
"this QEMU package. Finally, Bob leverages sVirt to manage the SELinux "
"polices associated with the virtualization stack."
