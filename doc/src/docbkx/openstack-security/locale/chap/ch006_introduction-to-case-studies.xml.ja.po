"Alice is deploying a private cloud for use by a government department in the "
"US. The cloud must comply with relevant standards such as FedRAMP. The "
"security paperwork requirements for this cloud are very high. It will have "
"no direct access to the internet, its API endpoints, compute instances and "
"other resources will be exposed only to systems within the departments "
"network which is entirely air-gapped from all other networks. The cloud can "
"access other network services on the Organization's Intranet e.g. the "

"Bob is a lead architect for a company deploying a large greenfield public "
"cloud. This cloud will provide IaaS for the masses, allowing any consumer "
"with a valid credit-card access to utility computing and storage but the "
"primary focus is enterprise customers. Data privacy concerns are a big "
"priority for Bob as they are seen as a major barrier to large-scale adoption "
"of the cloud by organizations."
