"A lot of activity goes on within a cloud environment. It is a mix of "
"hardware, operating systems, virtual machine managers, the OpenStack "
"services, cloud-user activity such as creating instances and attaching "
"storage, the network underlying the whole, and finally end-users using the "
"applications running on the various instances."

"The generation and collection of logs is an important component of securely "
"monitoring an OpenStack infrastructure. Logs provide visibility into the day-"
"to-day actions of administrators, tenants, and guests, in addition to the "
"activity in the compute, networking, and storage and other components that "
"comprise your OpenStack deployment."

"The basics of logging: configuration, setting log level, location of the log "

"collections of logs is well covered in the OpenStack Operations Guide "

"For instance, analyzing the access logs of Keystone or its replacement "

"On detection, further action may be to black list an IP, or recommend "

"In the case of a OpenStack cloud instance, we need to monitor the hardware, "
"the OpenStack services, and the cloud resource usage. The last stems from "

"Here are a few important use cases to consider when implementing log "
"aggregation, analysis and monitoring. These use cases can be implemented and "
"monitored through various commercial and open source tools, homegrown "
"scripts, etc. These tools and scripts can generate events that can then be "
"sent to the administrators through email or integrated dashboard. It is "
"important to consider additional use cases that may apply to your specific "
"network and what you may consider anomalous behavior."

"Detecting the absence of log generation is an event of high value. Such an "

"To reduce security risks from orphan instances on a user/tenant/domain "

"Security monitoring controls such as intrusion detection software, antivirus "
"software, and spyware detection and removal utilities can generate logs that "

"on the cloud machines provides value and protection. Cloud users, those "
"running instances on the cloud may also want to run such tools on their "
