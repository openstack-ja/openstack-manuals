"Alice has a need for lots of high quality entropy in the instances. For this "
"reason, she decides to purchase hardware with Intel Ivy Bridge chip sets "

"entropy pool is distributed to the instances on each compute node."

"For instance scheduling, Alice uses the trusted compute pools to ensure that "
"all cloud workloads are deployed to nodes that presented a proper boot time "

"to help ensure that the images used in the cloud are generated in a known "
"and trusted manner by the cloud administrators."

"Finally, Alice disables instance migrations as this feature is less critical "

"Bob is aware that entropy will be a concern for some of his customers, such "

"Bob is interested in ensuring that customers receive a high quality of "

"instance scheduling could negatively impact the quality of service. So he "
"disables this feature. Bob provides images in the cloud from a known trusted "
"source for users to use. Additionally, he also allows users to upload their "
"own images. However, users cannot generally share their images. This helps "
"prevent a user from sharing a malicious image, which could negatively impact "
"the security of other users in the cloud."

"For migrations, Bob wants to enable secure instance migrations in order to "

"However, he makes a note to track this carefully and switch to encryption "
"migrations as soon as possible."
