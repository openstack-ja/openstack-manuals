"When scoping OpenStack deployments for compliance purposes, consider "

"Scope reduction helps ensure OpenStack architects establish high quality "
"security controls which are tailored to a particular deployment, however it "
"is paramount to ensure these practices do not omit areas or features from "
"security hardening. A common example is applicable to PCI-DSS guidelines, "
"where payment related infrastructure may be scrutinized for security issues, "
"but supporting services are left ignored, and vulnerable to attack. "

"When addressing compliance, you can increase efficiency and reduce work "

"This is the formal audit process. Auditors will test security controls in "

"period).  Any control failures are logged, and will be documented in the "
"external auditors final report.  Dependent on the type of OpenStack "
"deployment, these reports may be viewed by customers, so it is important to "

"The process doesn't end with a single external audit. Most certifications "
"require continual compliance activities which means repeating the audit "

"verification tools into a cloud to ensure that it is compliant at all times. "
"This should be in done in addition to other security monitoring tools. "
"Remember that the goal is both security <emphasis>and</emphasis> compliance. "
"Failing on either of these fronts will significantly complicate future "
