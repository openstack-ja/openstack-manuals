"Openstack Networking is a standalone service that often involves deploying "
"several processes across a number of nodes. These processes interact with "
"each other and with other Openstack services. The main process of the "
"Openstack Networking service is neutron-server, a Python daemon that exposes "
"the Openstack Networking API and passes tenant requests to a suite of "
"plugins for additional processing."

"network node to service the Networking API and its extensions. It also "
"enforces the network model and IP addressing of each port. The neutron-"
"server and plugin agents require access to a database for persistent storage "
"and access to a message queue for inter-communication."
