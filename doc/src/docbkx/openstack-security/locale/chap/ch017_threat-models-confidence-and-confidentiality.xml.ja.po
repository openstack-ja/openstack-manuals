"While it is commonly accepted that data over public networks should be "
"secured using cryptographic measures, such as Secure Sockets Layer or "
"Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocols, it is insufficient to rely on "
"security domain separation to protect internal traffic. Using a security-in-"
"depth approach, we recommend securing all domains with SSL/TLS, including "
"the management domain services. It is important that should a tenant escape "
"their VM isolation and gain access to the hypervisor or host resources, "
"compromise an API endpoint, or any other service, they must not be able to "
"easily inject or capture messages, commands, or otherwise affect or control "
"management capabilities of the cloud. SSL/TLS provides the mechanisms to "
"ensure authentication, non-repudiation, confidentiality, and integrity of "
"user communications to the OpenStack services and between the OpenStack "
"services themselves."

"PKI builds the framework on which to provide encryption algorithms, cipher "

"recommend securing all services with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), "
"including the use of SSL/TLS for API endpoints. It is impossible for the "
"encryption or signing of transports or messages alone to solve all these "
"problems. Hosts themselves must be secure and implement policy, namespaces, "
"and other controls to protect their private credentials and keys. However, "
"the challenges of key management and protection do not reduce the necessity "

"It is recommended that the OpenStack cloud architect rely on distinct sets "
"of CAs -- one or more for the management network and internal service "
"communications, and the trusted set of public CA providers for allowing "
"external users to verify the identity of the public cloud endpoints. "
"Configuring the internal service communications to only rely on an internal "
