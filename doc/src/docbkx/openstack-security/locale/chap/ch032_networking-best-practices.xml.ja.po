"VLANs are realized as packets on a specific physical network containing IEEE "

"sharing the same physical network are isolated from each other at L2, and "
"can even have overlapping IP address spaces. Each distinct physical network "

"VLAN configuration complexity depends on your OpenStack design "

"Network tunneling encapsulates each tenant/network combination with a unique "
"\"tunnel-id\" that is used to identify the network traffic belonging to that "
"combination. The tenant's L2 network connectivity is independent of physical "
"locality or underlying network design. By encapsulating traffic inside IP "
"packets, that traffic can cross Layer-3 boundaries, removing the need for "
"preconfigured VLANs and VLAN trunking. Tunneling adds a layer of obfuscation "
"to network data traffic, reducing the visibility of individual tenant "
"traffic from a monitoring point of view."

"The choice of technology to provide L2 isolation is dependent upon the scope "
