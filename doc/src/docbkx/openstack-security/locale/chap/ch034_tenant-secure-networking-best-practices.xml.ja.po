"If your deployment of Openstack provides multiple external access points "

"ability to attach multiple vNICs to multiple external access points -- this "
"would bridge these security domains and could lead to unforseen security "
"compromise. It is possible mitigate this risk by utilizing the host "
"aggregates functionality provided by Openstack Compute or through splitting "
"the tenant VMs into multiple tenant projects with different virtual network "

"The OpenStack Networking Service provides security group functionality using "
"a mechanism that is more flexible and powerful than the security group "
"capabilities built into OpenStack Compute. Thus, when using OpenStack "
"Networking, <emphasis>nova.conf</emphasis> should always disable built-in "
"security groups and proxy all security group calls to the OpenStack "
"Networking API. Failure to do so will result in conflicting security "
"policies being simultaneously applied by both services. To proxy security "
"groups to OpenStack Networking, use the following configuration values:"

"Security groups and security group rules allow administrators and tenants "

"created in OpenStack Networking it is associated with a security group. If a "
"security group is not specified, the port will be associated with a "
"'default' security group. By default this group will drop all ingress "
"traffic and allow all egress. Rules can be added to this group in order to "
