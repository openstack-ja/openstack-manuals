"An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a comprehensive set of "
"policies and processes that an organization creates and maintains to manage "
"risk to information assets. The most common ISMS for cloud deployments is "
"ISO/IEC 27001/2 (http://www.27000.org/iso-27001.htm), which creates a solid "
"foundation of security controls and practices for achieving more stringent "
"compliance certifications."

"A Risk Assessment framework identifies risks within an organization or "
"service, and specifies ownership of these risks, along with implementation "
"and mitigation strategies. Risks apply to all areas of the service, from "
"technical controls to environmental disaster scenarios and human elements, "
"for example a malicious insider (or rogue employee). Risks can be rated "
"using a variety of mechanisms, for example likelihood vs impact. An "
"OpenStack deployment risk assessment can include control gaps that are "
"described in this book."

"Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Planning (BCP) plans are "
"common requirements for ISMS and compliance activities. These plans must be "
"periodically tested as well as documented. In OpenStack key areas are found "
"in the management security domain, and anywhere that single points of "
"failure (SPOFs) can be identified. See the section on secure backup and "
"recovery for additional details."

"Annual, role-specific, security training is a mandatory requirement for "
"almost all compliance certifications and attestations. To optimise the "
"effectiveness of security training, a common method is to provide role "
"specific training, for example to developers, operational personnel, and non-"
"technical employees. Additional cloud security or OpenStack security "
"training based on this hardening guide would be ideal."

msgid ""
"As OpenStack is a popular open source project, much of the codebase and "
"architecture has been scrutinized by individual contributors, organizations "
"and enterprises. This can be advantageous from a security perspective, "
"however the need for security reviews is still a critical consideration for "
"service providers, as deployments vary, and security is not always the "
"primary concern for contributors. A comprehensive security review process "
"may include architectural review, threat modelling, source code analysis and "
"penetration testing. There are many techniques and recommendations for "
"conducting security reviews that can be found publicly posted. A well-tested "
"example is the Microsoft SDL, created as part of the Microsoft Trustworthy "
"Computing Initiative (http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/process/release."
"aspx)."

"Security updates are critical to any IaaS deployment, whether private or "
"public. Vulnerable systems expand attack surfaces, and are obvious targets "
"for attackers. Common scanning technologies and vulnerability notification "
"services can help mitigate this threat. It is important that scans are "
"authenticated and that mitigation strategies extend beyond simple perimeter "
"hardening. Multi-tenant architectures such as OpenStack are particularly "
"prone to hypervisor vulnerabilities, making this a critical part of the "
"system for vulnerability management. See the section on instance isolation "
"for additional details."

msgid ""
"Data Classification defines a method for classifying and handling "
"information, often to protect customer information from accidental or "
"deliberate theft, loss, or inappropriate disclosure. Most commonly this "
"involves classifying information as sensitive or non-sensitive, or as "
"personally identifiable information (PII). Depending on the context of the "
"deployment various other classifying criteria may be used (government, "
"health-care etc). The underlying principle is that data classifications are "
"clearly defined and in-use. The most common protective mechanisms include "
"industry standard encryption technologies. See the data security section for "
"additional details."

msgid ""
"An exception process is an important component of an ISMS. When certain "
"actions are not compliant with security policies that an organization has "
"defined, they must be logged. Appropriate justification, description and "
"mitigation details need to be included, and signed off by appropriate "
"authorities. OpenStack default configurations may vary in meeting various "
"compliance criteria, areas that fail to meet compliance requirements should "
"be logged, with potential fixes considered for contribution to the community."
