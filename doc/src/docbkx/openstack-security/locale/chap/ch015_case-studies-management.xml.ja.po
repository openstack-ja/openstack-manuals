"When building her private cloud, while air-gapped, Alice still needs to "
"consider her service management interfaces. Before deploying her private "
"cloud, Alice has completed her system documentation. Specifically she has "
"identified which OpenStack services will exist in each security domain. From "
"there Alice has further restricted access to management interfaces by "
"deploying a combination of IDS, SSL encryption, and physical network "
"isolation. Additionally, Alice requires high availability and redundant "
"services. Thus, Alice sets up redundant infrastructure for various OpenStack "
"API services."

"Alice also needs to provide assurances that the physical servers and "

"configuration. To enable this, Alice uses a combination of a Configuration "
"Management platform to configure each machine according to the standards and "
"regulations she must comply with. It will also enable Alice to report "
"periodically on the state of her cloud and perform remediation to a known "
"state should anything be out of the ordinary. Additionally, Alice provides "
"hardware assurances by using a PXE system to build her nodes from a known "
"set of base images. During the boot process, Alice provides further "
"assurances by enabling TXT and related trusted boot technologies provided by "
"the hardware."

"As a public cloud provider, Bob is concerned with both the continuous "

"the management interfaces. To that end Bob implements multiple redundant "
"OpenStack API endpoints for the services his cloud will run. Additionally on "
"the public network Bob uses SSL to encrypt all transactions between his "
"customers and his cloud interfaces. To isolate his cloud operations Bob has "
"physically isolated his management, instance migration, and storage networks."
