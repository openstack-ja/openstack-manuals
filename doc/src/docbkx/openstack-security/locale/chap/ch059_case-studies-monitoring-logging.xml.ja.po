"In this case study we discuss how Alice and Bob would address monitoring and "
"logging in the public vs a private cloud. In both instances, time "
"synchronization and a centralized store of logs become extremely important "
"for performing proper assessments and troubleshooting of anomalies. Just "
"collecting logs is not very useful, a robust monitoring system must be built "
"to generate actionable events."

"In the private cloud, Alice has a better understanding of the tenants "
"requirements and accordingly can add appropriate oversight and compliance on "
"monitoring and logging. Alice should identify critical services and data and "
"ensure that logging is turned at least on those services and is being "
"aggregated to a central log server. She should start with simple and known "
"use cases and implement correlation and alerting to limit the number of "
"false positives. To implement correlation and alerting, she sends the log "
"data to her organization's existing SIEM tool. Security monitoring should be "
"an ongoing process and she should continue to define use cases and alerts as "
"she has better understanding of the network traffic activity and usage over "
"time."

"When it comes to logging, as a public cloud provider, Bob is interested in "
"logging both for situational awareness as well as compliance. That is, "
"compliance that Bob as a provider is subject to as well as his ability to "
"provide timely and relevant logs or reports on the behalf of his customers "
"for their compliance audits. With that in mind, Bob configures all of his "
"instances, nodes, and infrastructure devices to perform time synchronization "
"with an external, known good time device. Additionally, Bob's team has built "
"a Django based web applications for his customers to perform self-service "
"log retrieval from Bob's SIEM tool. Bob also uses this SIEM tool along with "
"a robust set of alerts and integration with his CMDB to provide operational "
"awareness to both customers and cloud administrators."
