"Privacy is an increasingly important element of a compliance program. "
"Businesses are being held to a higher standard by their customers, who have "
"increased interest in understanding how their data is treated from a privacy "

"An OpenStack deployment will likely need to demonstrate compliance with an "
"organization’s Privacy Policy, with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework, "
"the ISO/IEC 29100:2011 privacy framework or with other privacy-specific "
"guidelines. In the U.S. the AICPA has defined 10 privacy areas of focus, "
"OpenStack deployments within a commercial environment may desire to attest "
"to some or all of these principles. (http://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/"

"Comprehensive privacy management requires significant preparation, thought "
"and investment. Additional complications are introduced when building global "
"OpenStack clouds, for example navigating the differences between U.S. and "
"more restrictive E.U. privacy laws. In addition, extra care needs to be "
"taken when dealing with sensitive PII that may include information such as "
"credit card numbers or medical records. This sensitive data is not only "
"subject to privacy laws but also regulatory and governmental regulations. By "
"deferring to established best practices, including those published by "
"governments, a holistic privacy management policy may be created and "
"practiced for OpenStack deployments."
