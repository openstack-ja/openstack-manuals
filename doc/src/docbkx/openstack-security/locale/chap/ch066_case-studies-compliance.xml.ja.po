"In this case study we discuss how Alice and Bob would address common "

"Alice is building an OpenStack private cloud for the United States "
"government, specifically to provide elastic compute environments for signal "
"processing. Alice has researched government compliance requirements, and has "
"identified that her private cloud will be required to certify against FISMA "
"and follow the FedRAMP accreditation process, which is required for all "
"federal agencies, departments and contractors to become a Certified Cloud "
"Provider (CCP). In this particular scenario for signal processing, the FISMA "
"controls required will most likely be FISMA High, which indicates possible "
"\"severe or catastrophic adverse effects\" should the information system "
"become compromised. In addition to FISMA Moderate controls Alice must ensure "
"her private cloud is FedRAMP certified, as this is a requirement for all "
"agencies that currently utilize, or host federal information within a cloud "
"environment."

"Defense is involved, Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) will "
"come into play, which are the configuration standards for DOD IA and IA-"
"enabled devices / systems. Alice notices a number of complications here as "
"there is no STIG for OpenStack, so she must address several underlying "
"requirements for each OpenStack service, e.g. the networking SRG and "
"Application SRG will both be applicable (http://iase.disa.mil/srgs/index."
"html). Other critical controls include ensuring that all identities in the "
"cloud use PKI, that SELinux is enabled, that encryption exists for all wire-"
"level communications, and that continuous monitoring is in place and clearly "
"documented. Alice is not concerned with object encryption, as this will be "
"the tenants responsibility rather than the provider."

"Bob is tasked with compliance for a new OpenStack public cloud deployment, "
"that is focused on providing cloud services to both small developers and "
"startups, as well as large enterprises. Bob recognizes that individual "
"developers are not necessarily concerned with compliance certifications, but "
"to larger enterprises certifications are critical. Specifically Bob desires "
"to achieve SOC 1, SOC 2 Security, as well as ISO 27001/2 as quickly as "
"possible. Bob references the Cloud Security Alliance Cloud Control Matrix "
"(CCM) to assist in identifying common controls across these three "
"certifications (such as periodic access reviews, auditable logging and "
"monitoring services, risk assessment activities, security reviews, etc). Bob "
"then engages an experienced audit team to conduct a gap analysis on the "
"public cloud deployment, reviews the results and fills any gaps identified. "
"Bob works with other team members to ensure that these security controls and "
"activities are regularly conducted for a typical audit period (~6-12 months)."

"ensuring security controls are in place for his OpenStack public cloud, "
"there are no additional gaps exposed on the report. Bob can now provide "
