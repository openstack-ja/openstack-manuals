"Virtualization provides flexibility and other key benefits that enable cloud "

"isolation can be less than perfect. Making intelligent selections for "

"To wrap up our discussion around hypervisor selection, it is important to "
"call out the differences between using LXC (Linux Containers) or Baremetal "
"systems vs using a hypervisor like KVM. Specifically, the focus of this "
"security guide will be largely based on having a hypervisor and "
"virtualization platform. However, should your implementation require the use "
"of a baremetal or LXC environment, you will want to pay attention to the "
"particular differences in regard to deployment of that environment. In "
"particular, you will need to provide your end users with assurances that the "
"node has been properly sanitized of their data prior to re-provisioning. "
"Additionally, prior to reusing a node, you will need to provide assurances "
