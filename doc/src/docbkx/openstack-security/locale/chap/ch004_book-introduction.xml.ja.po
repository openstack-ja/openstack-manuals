"This guide provides security insight into OpenStack deployments. The "
"intended audience includes cloud architects, deployers, and administrators. "
" In addition, cloud users will find the guide both educational and helpful "
"in provider selection, while auditors will find it useful as a reference "
"document to support their compliance certification efforts. This guide is "
"also recommended for anyone interested in cloud security."

"Each OpenStack deployment embraces a wide variety of technologies, spanning "

"components themselves, access control policies, logging services, security "
"monitoring tools, and much more. It should come as no surprise that the "
"security issues involved are equally diverse, and their in-depth analysis "
"would require several guides. We strive to find a balance, providing enough "
"context to understand OpenStack security issues and their handling, and "
"provide external references for further information. The guide could be read "
"from start to finish or sampled as necessary like a reference."

"OpenStack is a key enabler in adoption of cloud technology and has several "
"common deployment use cases. These are commonly known as Public, Private, "
"and Hybrid models. The following sections use the National Institute of "
"Standards and Technology (NIST) definition of cloud (http://csrc.nist.gov/"
"publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf) to introduce these different "
"types of cloud as they apply to OpenStack."

msgstr ""

#: doc/src/docbkx/openstack-security/ch004_book-introduction.xml:12
msgid ""
"According to NIST, a public cloud is one in which the infrastructure is open "
"to the general public for consumption. OpenStack public clouds are typically "
"run by a service provider and can be consumed by individuals, corporations, "
"or any paying customer. A public cloud provider may expose a full set of "
"features such as software defined networking, block storage, in addition to "
"multiple instance types. Due to the nature of public clouds, they will be "
"exposed to a higher degree of risk. As a consumer of a public cloud you "
"should validate that your selected provider has the necessary "
"certifications, attestations, and other regulatory considerations. As a "
"public cloud provider, depending on your target customers, you may be "
"subject to one or more regulations. Additionally, even if not required to "
"meet regulatory requirements, a provider should ensure tenant isolation as "
"well as protecting management infrastructure from external attacks."

#: doc/src/docbkx/openstack-security/ch004_book-introduction.xml:16
msgid ""
"At the opposite end of the spectrum is the private cloud. As NIST defines "
"it, a private cloud is provisioned for exclusive use by a single "
"organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g. business units). It may be "
"owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third-party, or some "
"combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. Private cloud use "

"NIST defines a community cloud as one whose  infrastructure is provisioned "

"organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security "

"managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, "

msgid "Hybrid Cloud"
msgstr ""

#: doc/src/docbkx/openstack-security/ch004_book-introduction.xml:24
msgid ""
"A hybrid cloud is defined by NIST as a composition of two or more distinct "
"cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique "
"entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology "
"that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load "
"balancing between clouds).  For example an online retailer may have their "
"advertising and catalogue presented on a public cloud that allows for "
"elastic provisioning. This would enable them to handle seasonal loads in a "
"flexible, cost-effective fashion. Once a customer begins to process their "
"order, they are transferred to the more secure private cloud backend that is "
"PCI compliant."

"For the purposes of this document, we treat Community and Hybrid similarly, "
"dealing explicitly only with the extremes of Public and Private clouds from "
"a security perspective. Your security measures will depend where your "
"deployment falls upon the private public continuum."
