"The system documentation for an OpenStack cloud deployment should follow the "
"templates and best practices for the Enterprise Information Technology "
"System in your organization. Organizations often have compliance "
"requirements which may require an overall System Security Plan to inventory "
"and document the architecture of a given system. There are common challenges "
"across the industry related to documenting the dynamic cloud infrastructure "
"and keeping the information up-to-date."

"Documentation should provide a general description of the OpenStack "
"environment and cover all systems used (production, development, test, "
"etc.). Documenting system components, networks, services, and software often "
"provides the bird's-eye view needed to thoroughly cover and consider "
"security concerns, attack vectors and possible security domain bridging "
"points.  A system inventory may need to capture ephemeral resources such as "
"virtual machines or virtual disk volumes that would otherwise be persistent "
"resources in a traditional IT system."

"Clouds without stringent compliance requirements for written documentation "
"may at least benefit from having a Configuration Management Database (CMDB). "
"CMDB's are normally used for hardware asset tracking and overall life-cycle "
"management. By leveraging a CMDB, an organization can quickly identify cloud "
"infrastructure hardware (e.g. compute nodes, storage nodes, and network "
"devices) that exists on the network but may not be adequately protected and/"
"or forgotten. OpenStack provisioning system may provide some CMDB-like "
"functions especially if auto-discovery features of hardware attributes are "
"available."

"Just as with hardware, all software components within the OpenStack "
"deployment should be documented. Components here should include system "
"databases; OpenStack software components and supporting sub-components; and, "
"supporting infrastructure software such as load-balancers, reverse proxies "
"and network address translators. Having an authoritative list like this may "
"be critical toward understanding total system impact due to a compromise or "

"A Network Topology should be provided with highlights specifically calling "

"ingress and egress points should be identified along with any OpenStack "
"logical system boundaries. Multiple diagrams may be needed to provide "
"complete visual coverage of the system.  A network topology document should "
"include virtual networks created on behalf of tenants by the system along "
"with virtual machine instances and gateways created by OpenStack."

"The Service, Protocols and Ports table provides important additional detail "

"remediation areas, and compliance requirements become easier to manage when "
"you have concise information available. E.g. tabular information as shown "
