"To address the often mentioned concern of tenant data privacy and limiting "
"cloud provider liability, there is greater interest within the OpenStack "
"community to make data encryption more ubiquitous. It is relatively easy for "
"an end-user to encrypt their data prior to saving it to the cloud, and a "
"this is a viable path for tenant objects such as media files, database "
"archives among others. However, when client side encryption is used for "
"virtual machine images, block storage etc, client intervention is necessary "
"in the form of presenting keys to unlock the data for further use. To "
"seamlessly secure the data and yet have it accessible without burdening the "
"client with having to manage their keys and interactively provide them calls "
"for a key management service within OpenStack. Providing encryption and key "
"management services as part of OpenStack eases data-at-rest security "
"adoption, addresses customer concerns about the privacy and misuse of their "
"data with the added advantage of limiting cloud provider liability. Provider "
"liability is of concern in multi-tenant public clouds with respect to "
"handing over tenant data during a misuse investigation."

"A key management service is in the early stages of being developed and has a "

"It shall support the creation of keys, and their secure saving (with a "
"service master-key). Some of the design questions still being debated are "
"how much of the Key Management Interchange Protocol (KMIP) to support, key "
"formats, and certificate management.Â  The key manager will be pluggable to "
"facilitate deployments that need a third-party Hardware Security Module "
"(HSM)."
