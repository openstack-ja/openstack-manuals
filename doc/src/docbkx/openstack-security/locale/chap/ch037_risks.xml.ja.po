msgid ""
"Both RabbitMQ and Qpid are Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) "
"frameworks which provide message queues for peer-to-peer communication. "
"Queue implementations are typically deployed as centralized or decentralized "
"pool of queue servers. ZeroMQ differs by communicating directly using TCP "
"sockets between peers."

msgid ""
"Message queues effectively facilitate command and control functions across "
"OpenStack deployments. Once access to the queue is permitted no further "
"authorization checks are performed. Services accessible via the queue do "
"validate the contexts and tokens within the actual message payload. However, "
"awareness of the token's expiration value should be noted as these tokens "
"are potentially replayable and may provide authorization for other services "
"within the infrastructure."

"OpenStack does not support message-level confidence (i.e., message signing). "
"Because of this, the message transport itself must be secured and "
"authentication to the queue server must be performed. For HA configurations, "
"queue to queue authentication and encryption should to be performed as well."

"With ZeroMQ messaging, IPC sockets are used on individual machines. These "
"sockets may be vulnerable to attack for local message injection and snooping "
"unless secured by an operator."
