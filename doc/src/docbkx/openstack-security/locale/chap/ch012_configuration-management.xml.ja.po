"as OpenStack. By producing the manifests, cookbooks, or templates required "
"for a configuration management utility, you are able to satisfy a number of "

"management can also function as part of your BCP and DR plans wherein you "

"Additionally, when combined with a version control system such as Git or "

"configuration management tool will be able to revert or replace the file and "
"bring your configuration back into a known state. Finally a configuration "
"management tool can also be used to deploy updates; simplifying the security "
"patch process. These tools have a broad range of capabilities that are "
